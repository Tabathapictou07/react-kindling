# React.s Kindling

This is a React.js starter project. You can use it to build a client only application or a full stack node.js application.

## What's included
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)                                        - For building assets, launching development servers and deploying
- [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)                              - For bundling javascript and other assets as required
- [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)   - For quick reloads of css and js changes
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/)                                  - For middleware and serving pages

- [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)                                - For talking to MongoDB
- [MaterialUi](http://callemall.github.io/material-ui/#/)           - Because not everything has to be Bootstrap


## Usage

__Clone this repository:__

`git clone git@github.com:jbasdf/react-kindling.git`

__Install the dependencies:__

`npm install`

__Configuration:__

Change `config/secrets.example.js` to `config/secrets.js`. Change `sessionSecret` and set your database. If you want
to use Facebook, Twitter or Google for authentication setup your keys and secrets.

__Development mode with livereload:__

To start node and the webpack server just type:
`gulp`

Or start each one individually
node server.js
gulp serve:hot


## Development
You can use React-Kindling to build a client only application or a client-server application.

### Client Only
Open up settings. Change 'projectType' to 'client'. When you run 'gulp' all of the assets in the 'client' directory
will be built into a client only html/js/css application. The development files will be found in /build and the
production files will be in /public.

### Client Server
Open up settings.

Change 'projectType' to 'client-server'.
Set applicationUrl to your domain.

Pass values from the server to the client via `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`. This code can be found in index.ejs.

#### ngrok
Ngrok makes it easy to provide a public url to an application running on your local machine. This
comes in handy when dealing with OAuth providers that don't permit localhost. Install ngrok - https://ngrok.com/
and then run two instances one for the node server and another for the webpack server:

`ngrok --subdomain myserversubdomain 8888`
`ngrok --subdomain myassetssubdomain 8080`

Change the subdomains to be a value you prefer and then update applicationUrl and assetsUrl
in secrets.js to match your changes.


## Testing
React Kindling uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for tests

Run `npm test`

## Database

### Migrations
React Kindling uses MongoDB. PostGreSQL support is coming. Here are some resources:

- https://github.com/kunklejr/node-db-migrate
- https://github.com/thuss/standalone-migrations
- https://github.com/rosenfeld/active_record_migrations

## Setup

Sensitive values live in:
config/secrets.js

Build configuration lives in:
config/settings.js

## Deployment


### Client Only

React.js Kindling can be used to build a client only application that can be deployed to Amazon S3 or Github pages or
any other static hosting service

__Create a production ready version of the JS bundle:__

`gulp build --release`

Then upload the contents of the 'public' folder to your favorite service.

__Deploy to Amazon__
React.js Kindling uses the Ruby gem [s3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) to deploy.
run gulp deploy:amazon


__Deploy to Github Page__
run gulp deploy:github

### Client Server
